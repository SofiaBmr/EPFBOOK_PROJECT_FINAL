The character of ID 5 in the Rick and Morty API is Jerry Smith. To find it, I looked at the documentation at https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character and then used Insomnia to use a GET method on the website adress plus the "/api" then "/character" and then "/the id" that we were looking for.
